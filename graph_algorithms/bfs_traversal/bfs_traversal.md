The basic difference in the implementation of BFS versus DFS deals with the data structure used. BFS uses a Queue data structure (which is FIFO). DFS uses a stack data structure (which is LIFO).

# BFS Pseudocode 

```
BFS (G, s)            # Where G is the graph and s is the source code 
  let Q be a queue 
  Q.enqueue( s )      # Inserting s in queue until all its neighbor vertices are marked. 
  
  mark s as visited 
  
  while ( Q is not empty )
    v = Q.dequeue()   # Remove the topmost vertex from queue
    
    # Process all the neighbors of V
    for all neighbors w of v in Graph G
      
      if w is not visited 
        Q.enqueue( w ) # Inserting w in Q to process it in the correct order 
        mark w as visited 
```
