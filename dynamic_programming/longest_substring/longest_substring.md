# Longest Substring

The longest substring problem can take a few different forms. 

One such formulation of the problem goes like this:

"DNA sequence is made of characters A,C,G, and T, which represent nucleotides. A sample DNA string can be given as ACCGTTTAAAG. Finding similarities between two DNA sequences is a critical computation problem that is solved in bioinformatics. Given two DNA strings find the length of the longest common string alignment between them (it need not be continuous). Assume empty string does not match with anything."
