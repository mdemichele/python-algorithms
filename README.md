# Python Algorithms 
This my collection of famous algorithms - written in Python. The goal of the project is to simply a record of well-known algorithms and data structures for my personal reference. I imagine this repository will be helpful for future technical interviews, as well as for solving common workplace problems that will inevitably arise in the daily life of a software engineer.
