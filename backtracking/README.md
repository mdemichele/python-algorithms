# Backtracking Concepts 
The basic concept of backtracking is to perform a depth-first search for solutions, while jumping back to the last valid path as soon as you hit a dead end.

# Three Essential Questions
Ask these three questions to determine if backtracking is the correct approach:
1. Can you construct a partial solution?
2. Can you verify if the partial solution is invalid?
3. Can you verify is the solution is complete?
